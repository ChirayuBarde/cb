<p><i><center>The Challenge is to design a Battery Charger for Lithium Ion Battery with customable features  </center>
<center> including various indicators and alert systems. Three cell Lithium Ion battery was used in this project. </center>
<center> This project consists of two main blocks  </center>
<center> 1) SMPS- Switching Mode Power Supply  </center>
<center> 2) Battery Charging & Controlling Unit.  </center>
<center> </center>

<center> A Microcontroller was used to control the battery charging. The work was focused on controlling Unit.</center>
<center>Its hardware, firmware and PCBs were designed  by me. Alpha version of this product was tested successfully.</center>
